### Algorithm Purpose in Real Life
+ Our group's code is very good for creating illusions or entertaining people as it is both satisfying and interesting. Not only this, the code is capable of creating complex shapes that are equal.
### Explain your Code
+ Our app has 8 shapes that move from the center of the screen to the edge of the screen, then back to the center. But before this happens, we ask the user to pick a number from 1-360. This will determine the shape that is being drawn. Overall, this means there are over 360 different shapes to draw!
### Variables Involved
+ Our code will include booleans, if statements, lists, and nested loops
